The goal is to solve as much as possible of the 2021 advent of code with zsh.

Here and there, numpy solutions are added.

And very occasionally mixed c++/python solutions (i.e.: Implement most of the logic in c++. Use cppyy to generate python bindings for the c++ structs and functions. Handle input parsing and calling the c++ functions in python).
