1 → 2
7 → 3
4 → 4
2,3,5 → 5 (3 uses 2 of 1, 5 uses 3 of 4, 2 left over)
0,6,9 → 6 (9 uses all of 4, 0 uses both of 1 (if it's not a 9), 6 left over)
8 → 7

in hindsight:

e is used by 4 digits
b by 6
f by 9

d,g by 7 (can be distinguished: d is used in 4)
a,c by 8 (can be distinguished: c is used by 4)
